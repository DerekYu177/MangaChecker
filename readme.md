This is a simple CLI based system for making sure you never miss when a new
manga comes out.

All you need to do is to fill out the `reading_file.txt`, or supply your own,
with the following format:

NAME\_OF\_MANGA : SITE\_TO\_READ

Initially I will be supporting only the sites that I use.

The output will be a pretty table with the following columns:

| name | last checked | updated | site-link |
